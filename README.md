**General**

This is the repo containing my notes and additions for the 2022 AQA A level skeleton code
I did not code this, These are just my notes for reference closer to the exam. I do not own any of this code.



**NOTES:**
    
    [2021/12/15 14:00]: Taking first looks at code, added .md
    [2021/12/15 14:20]: This code is not the worst, but awful
