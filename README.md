**General**

This is the repo containing my notes and additions for the 2022 AQA A level skeleton code
I did not code this, These are just my notes for reference closer to the exam. I do not own any of this code.

**NOTES:**

```
[2021/12/15 14:00]: Taking first looks at code, added .md
[2021/12/15 14:20]: This code is not the worst, but awful
[2021/12/30 xx:xx]: Tried adding comments to code but gave up, started hand tracing
[2021/12/31 13:15]: Hand traced startup to __SetupGame() and can be found in run.md
```
