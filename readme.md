# **Content**

## im gonna add a contents page when i've actually properly formatted and written this readme

FYI the annotated python file is best read with BetterComments, I wrote stuff in it because it gives the comments different colours don't @ me on how I use it

# **log**

```
[07/01/22@11:28] Edited the main file's name to game.py and adding new annotations from where I left off (Near start of the PlayGame method)
[07/01/22@11:39] Side note why is the formatting so bad? a single print() statement just to create a line break when in the very next method you decided to use the \n escape code??? Super strange.
[07/01/22@11:41] Commit because this green untracked file name (renamed file) is really annoying me
[07/01/22@12:07] Turns out they wrote a method to dynamically print the line of dashes for formatting which is ok I guess, why were their previous formatting decisions so bad??
       ''        Inconsistent line breaking methods, different people working on the same thing and not coordinating???
[07/01/22@12:25] Getting hungry so one of the last things I do for now, committing with the previous comments (not many extra really)
       ''        Slightly impressed at the lengths gone to make the program properly format itself sometimes, not so impressed by the fact the program is a bit broken
[10/01/22@11:23] You saw no e flashback cos contents on this readme was spelled as contetnts
