## im gonna add a contetnts page when i've actually properly formatted and written this readme

#

FYI the annotated python file is best read with BetterComments, I wrote stuff in it because it gives the comments different colours don't @ me on how I use it

# **log**

```
[7/1/22@11:28] Edited the main file's name to game.py and adding new annotations from where I left off (Near start of the PlayGame method)
[7/1/22@11:39] Side note why is the formatting so bad? a single print() statement just to create a line break when in the very next method you decided to use the \n escape code??? Super strange.
[7/1/22@11:41] Commit because this green untracked file name (renamed file) is really annoying me
[7/1/22@12:07] Turns out they wrote a method to dynamically print the line of dashes for formatting which is ok I guess, why were their previous formatting decisions so bad??
       ''      Inconsistent line breaking methods, different people working on the same thing and not coordinating???
